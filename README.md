# BuyBliss
BuyBliss is an e-commerce application developed using Android Studio. It is integrated with a firebase and takes data directly from a realtime database.

It has 7 main pages
1. Home page (main activity)
2. Product page
3. Cart page
4. Profile page
5. Register page
6. Login page
7. Loading page

Every data of the product is taken from firebase, image included. Almost every feature is interactive, however, this is still a prototype and will be developed further
